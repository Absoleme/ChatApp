# ChattApp

In this project, you are asked to create a network based  multithreaded client-server chat app. 

Chatters establish a connection with the server and can do the following :



Create a profile (login, password) and save it
login
List topics
create topics
join topics (only one - bonus : many at the same time)
send messages to all chatters on a specific topic
send private messages 
...
You are free to add new functions to your app, but don't do that unless you've already implemented the ones given above. A graphical interface can be added to your app but this has to be the last phase in your project. 

You should start this project by doing a full object oriented design of your desired app. This has to be documented in your report and presented to your supervisor (use UML diagrams for that purpose; use-case, sequence, state-transition, class, ... diagrams). 



EVALUATION

This is a PERSONAL project. You will be evaluated by your supervisor during the last lab hours (or before if you wish). 

You supervisor will control the following :

that you master every bit of code that you've written
that you made significant progress on the project; by the end of the labs, all of the functionalities cited above (from 1 to 6) should be operational (no need to present a GUI at this stage)


If you fail the presentation, your mark for the project is going to be under 10 no matter what you submit later. Therefore, I advise you prepare it very well by working hard from the start.



HANDIN

After your presentation, you will be given 2 weeks to finalize your project and submit it here.

You should submit the following :

A report (with you name on it) containing the following sections (in this order) : 1- Functions implemented, Functions not implemented or not finished + possible improvements, 2- your design + your implementation 3- screnshots from your app
your source code .
The zip file should be named as follows : lastname_firstname.zip
